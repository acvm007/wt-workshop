1. Low-Level API for neural network inference hardware acceleration
2. Hardware agnostic abstraction Layer to use ML capabilities of underlying OS
3. Not tied to platform specific capabilities
4. Provides Browsers with abillity to run ML Networks through Browser implementation using the native ML APIs of the OS
5. Does not provide model serialization and model delivery machanism
6. Rely on supported browser Media Types
